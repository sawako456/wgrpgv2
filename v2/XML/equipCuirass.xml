		<eventText>You pull the cuirass over your head and stick your arms through the holes, allowing it to rest on your chest. The strap slides down your right arm. When you adjust it, the other strap slides down your left arm. It seems this armour is too big to fit on your body.</eventText>

		<eventText>You pull the cuirass over your head and stick your arms through the sleeves. The cuirass fits perfectly on your chest, as do the straps on your shoulders. This armour should be sufficient in defending your upper body. Your skirt is just the right length to be fashionable, although it leaves your legs exposed. Still, the armour forms a cute blend of fashion and defence. </eventText>

		<eventText>You pull the cuirass over your head and stick your arms through the sleeves. Pulling the chestpiece down requires some effort, but you manage to succeed. The straps are tight around your arms. The skirt leaves your legs bare to oncoming attacks, but that is just the nature of the armour.</eventText>

		<eventText>You pull the cuirass over your head and find the holes of the sleeves with some difficulty. The chestpiece fits extremely tight against your breasts. You nearly struggle for breath, but you figure the defence this armour provides is too valuable. The skirt barely covers the upper portion of your thighs.</eventText>
